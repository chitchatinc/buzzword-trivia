# Buzzword Player

Buzzword trivia app for old packets. Built using NextJS and Material UI.

Questions are read using [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API), which is only supported on modern browsers.

Chrome is the preferred browser - it'll read the questions using a nicer voice provided by
Google instead of the generic robot voice.

Packets are taken from:
